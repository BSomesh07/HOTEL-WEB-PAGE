Badges & extras

Badges: License badge, GitHub Pages badge, and a simple status badge (e.g., Docs or Pages).
Normalize filenames: Remove spaces and normalize to lowercase (e.g., home-page.html) to avoid URL-encoding issues. I can do this if you want.
GitHub Pages: Recommend using main branch / gh-pages and set site to root; point to home-page.html as index or rename to index.html.
